# REPORT

### 1. (0.5 points) Report on the order and size of both networks. Explain why these numbers may be different from the number of rows in the TF-RISet file. 

### 2. (1.5 points) Report the number of TFs and TGs in both networks, and the fraction of genes in the E. coli network that are captured as being involved in transcriptional regulatory interactions in the RegulonDB dataset. What does this tell us about the genomic organization of the E. coli transcriptional regulatory network? 

### 3. (1 points) Report on the nodes with maximum in- and out-degree (and their respective in- and out-degrees). Are they the same on both networks? Why?
