# REPORT

### 1. (0.5 points) Report on the order and size of both networks. Explain why these numbers may be different from the number of rows in the TF-RISet file. 
#### Order and Size:
- Without operons:
    - Nodes (order): 1969
    - Edges (size): 3834

- With operons:
    - Nodes (order): 3170
    - Edges (size): 7800

This differs from the numbers of rows in the TF-RISet file because some rows encode interactions with multiple genes or operons.

### 2. (1.5 points) Report the number of TFs and TGs in both networks, and the fraction of genes in the E. coli network that are captured as being involved in transcriptional regulatory interactions in the RegulonDB dataset. What does this tell us about the genomic organization of the E. coli transcriptional regulatory network? 




### 3. (1 points) Report on the nodes with maximum in- and out-degree (and their respective in- and out-degrees). Are they the same on both networks? Why?
